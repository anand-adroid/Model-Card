# Model-Card for the HML models analyzed in the paper "Advancing Trust in Real-World Healthcare AI: A Framework for Enhanced Transparency and Fairness"

For trustworthy HML modeling, model techniques and considerations play a crucial role in addition to the data. It is essential to know how a model was trained, the data it was exposed to, and its expected behavior in various scenarios. This information is vital for identifying potential biases and understanding the model's limitations. Our "Model card" provides detailed documentation of ML models, including their intended use, performance metrics, and evaluation results across different demographic groups. It facilitates informed decision-making by providing a comprehensive overview of a model's strengths and weaknesses, promoting transparency. It enables practitioners to assess whether a model is suitable for deployment in sensitive applications like healthcare, where the implications of biased or inaccurate predictions can be life-altering. We followed the ["Model Cards for Model Reporting"](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.03993) framework to report on the analyzed HML models.
